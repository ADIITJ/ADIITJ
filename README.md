| Wiki-search to generate prompt with RAG      | The project extracts pertinent information from the top three search results on Wikipedia, which is then fed into the RAG Prompt Generator(repo below)   | [![wiki-search](wiki.png)](https://github.com/ADIITJ/Wiki-search)                                           |
| RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Prompt Generator | From scratch RAG Prompt Generator improves question answering by generating prompts from context provided by the user. Thus boosting accuracy. | [![RAG implementation](RAG.png)](https://github.com/ADIITJ/RAG-implementation)                             |
| Face Detection System with Webcam            | Live face detection system implemented from webcam feed.                                         | [![Face Detection](face.png)](https://github.com/ADIITJ/face_detection_webcam)                              |
| Computer Vision for Apparel Identification  | Utilized computer vision techniques to identify various types of apparel.                          | [![Computer Vision](fashion.png)](https://github.com/ADIITJ/basic-computer-vision)                           |
| Retrieval Chatbot with Custom Input          | Developed a retrieval-based chatbot with customizable input for interactive conversations.        | [![Chatbot](chatbot.jpg)](https://github.com/ADIITJ/retrieval-chatbot)                        |
